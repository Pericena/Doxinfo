# Doxinfo
```
**Doxing** or **doxxing** is the Internet practice of researching and publishing private or identifying
 information about an individual or organization. According to Wikipedia, doxing is the process of obtaining
information about a person through internet sources, using ingenuity and search skills. The word derives from
"document" in English and "ing," forming a gerund in that language: documenting or something similar, but doxing sounds better.
